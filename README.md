# June-Journey-Project
Mars Game is a game developed by Troy Neubauer in June 2016 for the school project June Journey. The point of the game is to land safely on ‘Mars’ without hitting any asteroids or the ground to fast. I achieved this by using 2D vectors to simulate gravity and basic physics. The entire source code is available. 

If you want to play the game, all you have to do is have Java installed. Than click the 2 releases tab the download the Mars Game .jar. Now all you have to do is double click on it.
